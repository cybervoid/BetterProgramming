# BetterProgramming
A repository for learning and improving with the capabilities of .NET

1. [BetterTasks](BetterTasks) - More study of the concept of tasks in .NET
2. [LearnAttributes](LearnAttributes) - A project to unlock the use of .NET attributes
3. [LearnFuncsActionsPreds](LearnFuncsActionsPreds) - I have an understanding of Functions, Actions, and predicates. But I've always wanted to dive deeper into the topic. Therefore, this is my attempt at improving my working knowledge in the area. This is derived from the youtube tutorial series [C# - Delegates, Lambda Expressions, and Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL2XHN6uJCg&amps;list=PLAE7FECFFFCBE1A54) by [Jamie King](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCda_RJU9-xB0Hswcrjn4SKw).
4. [Learn_PLINQ_Async_Tasks](Learn_PLINQ_Async_Tasks) - A project to improve skills relating to asynchronous, parallel processing, and PLINQ. This is based on the Udemy course [Write Asynchronous C# Code With Tasks and PLINQ](https://www.udemy.com/write-asynchronous-csharp-code-with-task-parallel-library-and-plinq/) by [Mark Farragher](https://www.udemy.com/user/markfarragher/)
    1. I highly recommend taking these course, the code alone will not sufficiently describe these .NET features.
5. [MVC](MVC) - study of MVC in .net
6. [MasterUnitTesting](./MasterUnitTesting) - a workspace to learn more about test driven development. Based upon the Udemy course [Master C# NUnit and Moq](https://www.udemy.com/nunit-moq/learn/)
