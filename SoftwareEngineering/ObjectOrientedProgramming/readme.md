# Object Oriented Programming



### Four Pillars of OOP
1. **Abstraction** - `Used to hide implementation details and display only essential features of the object.`
    1. By using access modifiers, we expose only the necessary methods and properties of the object.

2. **Encapsulation** - `Enclosing one of more items within a physical of logical package. Encapsulation prevents access to implementation details.`
    1. In C#, encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member.
    2. C# supports the following access specifiers:
        1. public
        2. private
        3. protected
        4. internal
        5. protected internal

3. **Polymorphism** - `In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple functions'.`
    1. Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism, it is decided at run-time.

4. **Inheritance** - `Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application.`
    1. A class can be derived from more than one class or interface, which means that it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes or interfaces.
